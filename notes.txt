Advanced Go Testing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1O0XI0scOM

Important notes: 
go test in the testing directory
OR 
go test -v in the testing directory


For large, enterprise testing, you'll want to include a go mod init file...
you should also specify a specific 'integration' testing file versus a standard testing 
file

In our example, that comment line actually designates what go test will run
To run the integration file, run: go test -tags=integration

ISSUE: build comment must appear before package clause error
